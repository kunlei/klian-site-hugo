In this post, we'll review some geometric properties of linear programming.

## Hyperplane

Let $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n)$ be a vector in $R^n$ and $a_i$ are not all 0, then the set defined by

$$
S = \\{ \mathbf{x} \in R^n \ | \ \mathbf{a}^T x = b \\}
$$

is called a *hyperplane*.
Note that the hyperplane defines a $(n-1)$-dimensional space within $R^n$.

## Halfspace
