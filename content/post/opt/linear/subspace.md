Subspace is an important concept in linear algebra and understanding it helps us grasp the intricacies of linear programming.
Let's say we have a $n$-dimensional space $\mathcal{R}^n$.
A subset $S$ is called a subspace of $\mathcal{R}^n$, denoted by $S \subseteq \mathcal{R}^n$, if the following three conditions are met:

+ $S$ is not empty, that is, $S \neq \\{0\\}$
+ $S$ is closed under vector addition, that is, $\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y} \in S, \ \forall \mathbf{x, y} \in S$.
+ $S$ is closed under scalar multiplication, that is, $a\mathbf{x} \in S, \ \forall a \in \mathcal{R}, \mathbf{x} \in S$.
