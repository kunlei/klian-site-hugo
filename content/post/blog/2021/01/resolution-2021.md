It's that time of year again to set up something that's for sure to be abandoned soon after, but it's better to have one in case I have the courage to compare the disparities between the goals I set up in the beginning of the year with what I've accomplished in the end.
It's also helpful to find out the areas that I have the penchant to slack off and direct more of my mental efforts to them if they're really important.
I'll use the same sections, with slightly different orders, as in last year's resolution.

## Exercise

I'll put physical health as number one in the list as it's crystal clear to me that maintaining a good physical health is beneficial to all other aspects of my life.
Not only will it help me stay energetic throughout long workdays, exercising is also a good way to relax and feel refreshed after.
I suffered some mild form of insomnia in the second part of 2020 and I believe regular exercise helped prevent it getting out of control.
With that being said, my goal in 2021 in this aspect would be keeping up the good habit and a more specific goal would be

+ running at least 30 kilometers every month

This should be an easy target based on my experience last year, if my knees don't object with the objective.
I finished almost 200 kilometers during the last few months of 2020 and 30 kilometers is about 10 times of running, which is about one in three days.

## Reading

Reading is another area that I did well in 2020 and the goal in the coming new year would be 

+ reading at least 20 books
  + this is the same with last year and the purpose is not to set too high a bar that distracts the real enjoyment.
+ writing at least 5 book reviews
  + this is a reduction from 10 book reviews from last year, which I failed miserably and I'll aim low in the coming year.

## Skills

It's clearly paramount to stay employed and honing my skills is the key to achieve that.
Luckily I like what I am doing and this shouldn't be much of a burden, but allocating time to this out of daily work schedules would be the main challenge.
There are a couple of areas I'd like to focus on this year:

+ optimization
  + theory - the goal is to digest the book about projection and get a deeper understanding of decomposition approaches.
  + application - the goal is to practice a big portion of the cplex examples.
+ Java
  + multi-threading - this would be helpful in daily development.
  + Spring framework - the goal is to have a solid understanding on at least one submodule of the framework
+ data structure and algorithm
  + understand and practice at least one core data structure and related algorithms.

Overall, I would expect honing and applying the skills will continue throughout the year.
2021 would be a busy year, with two big projects scheduled to go into production.

## Blogging

Writing has been something I always want to improve but keeps procrastinating.
I'll set a small goal for the coming year:

+ write one once every month, some candidate topics could be
  + monthly reviews
  + technical articles
  + optimization knowledge sharing

## English

The goal last year was to acquire 100 new words every month, which I completed for the most part and it really helped with the reading goal.
This year, I'll focus on the same 1200 words and solidify the learning.
In addition, it's imperative to improve my spoken english as well, for which the goal will be private - a secret project that putting the goal explicitly here would be embarrassing.

## Growth

This is the area I'll probably give up the first, so I'll aim high - it doesn't hurt to set a bigger objective knowing that it for sure cannot be achieved but a small amount of it would be meaningful still.

+ weekly reflection
+ monthly review
+ meditation - it's scary to even think of adding a frequency to this goal, so I'll consider it as ad hoc event.
