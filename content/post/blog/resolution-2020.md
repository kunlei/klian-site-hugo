It is about time to put down something for the new year, to either have solid evidence that goals are fulfilled or to have a published reason to berate myself. 
Consider it a one-year long experiment and see how it goes around the same time next year when I sit down to review this.

## Book reading

Given the fact that I finished more than 30 books in 2019, I want to set a mediocre target for 2020: 

+ 20 books
+ 10 book reviews

There should be at least two books in each of the categories: psychology, investing and economy.

## Skill acquisition

+ C++
+ Data structure and algorithm

## Blogging

+ 10 articles about C++
+ 10 articles about optimization

## English

+ 1500 new words

## Exercise

+ at least three times a week

## Personal growth

+ weekly and monthly reflection
