It's another end of the year and 2019 seems no different.
However, lots of things happened over the fleeting several months and reflection is overdue.
This is intended to glean some insights from this to-be-past year, good or bad.

I have vague memory about what happened in the beginning of the year.
On the work side, around March I embarked on a legacy project inherited from a person leaving the organization.
I spent lots of efforts rewriting the code, intending to fully understand the problem and make the maintenance and support easier for the years to come.
This innocuous effort had some surprising consequences, which taught me a lesson about the different ways people react to the same situation.
I recently read a phrase that goes like 'from pains we learn values' and this case is an exemplar of it.
This unpleasant experience revealed some principles I missed in the professional working environment.
For one, judgement should be made about whether it is really necessary and beneficial to rewrite a legacy code instead of building on top of it.
Working in a large technology department, taking over other's work is common and it is impossible to redo everything others have done.
The decision is really about whether the legacy code is easy to understand and maintain, and suffice to support continuous business requirements.
From the standpoint of code quality, I believe the majority of codes written by operations research scientist or so-called data scientist could use serious review and rewrite.
Like I found some code hard to interpret, my code is also far from perfect and other people may likely find my code stinky in many ways.
I still have no clear answer to this conundrum, but it's vital to keep an open mind and grow continuously.
For two, the ultimate purpose of an optimization project is to serve the business well, and in a timely manner. 
Probably the thing I did succeed in this was that the business was pretty happy with the results delivered.
Regardless of who builds the model or writes the code, at the end of the days, it's the solution delivered that decides whether the optimization effort is successful or not.
One can write perfect codes, but it would be useless if some business constraints are violated, or takes longer than expected time to deliver.
The Walmart cheer speaks that well by saying that the customer is always number one.

The following months witness my journey of becoming a self-taught full-stack, albeit at an amateur level, engineer. 
I was initially tasked with building an optimization engine and ended up creating a full-blown frontend application and backend service with database support.
