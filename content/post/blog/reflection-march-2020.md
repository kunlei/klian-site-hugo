### Event log

+ I managed to wake up early this morning to review some words and worked a little bit on the bike-sharing paper.
+ Today is the second week into the ocean procurement project for fiscal year 2021 and is also the first time I meet with the business in person this year. I had caught flu in the past week, which eventually infected all the family and we all stayed at home. I ran a few models in the first week, but one issue was uncovered during today's meeting. It was a mysterious bug in which the optimization results change even with the addition of irrelevant constraint or a simple duplication of an existing constraint. I spent the whole afternoon trying to pinpoint the issue, to no avail.
+ I finally went to Walmart to buy six bags of gardening soil, quite expensive!

### Achievements

A couple of things that are worth appraise.

+ Wake up early, haven't done that in a while; had a productive morning, reviewing some words and working on research paper.
+ Managed to make big progress on the gardening project.
+ Took time to exercise.

### Potentials

A few things that could be improved:

+ Afternoon time could be more productive.
