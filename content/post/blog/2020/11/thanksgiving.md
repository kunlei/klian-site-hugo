I have been "lazy" in the past few months about updating this blog.
There seemed to be endless tasks I needed to prioritize over writing posts.
But reflecting back, I couldn't come up with any significant achievements that worth mentioning here - being busy is more like an illusion or an excuse to avoid sitting down and producing something memorable.
The thing is, the more I postponed writing something, the harder I found it to ... write something.
It turns out to be not that hard, as is most of the times, to start writing, so here I am.

Growing up in China, thanksgiving has never been much of a holiday for me, it is still the same feeling now, even after spending almost ten years in the U.S.
We did have turkey, for the first time in our family life, this year, thanks to my wife's decision and many hours' efforts to prepare it.
The kids might experience some kind of cultural shock when they grow up and learn about the significance of having turkey during thanksgiving.
I am a meat person and my perception about turkey is largely being something that's dry and not enjoyable.
But it was better than expected, actually much better than I imagined.
Life lesson: eating turkey is a very different experience than reading other people's experience with turkey.

This year couldn't be more abnormal for most people due to the coronavirus.
We're stuck at home for the most part of the year and only see little hope to get back to normal life, maybe after the vaccine shot is widely taken.
However, I do feel more grateful in this trying times.
First, I am most grateful for the mostly good health my family is enjoying.
The kids used to have multiple rounds of getting sick throughout the year, which hasn't happened so far as they stay at home almost all the time.
My parents and parents-in-law are all physical okay, but they are reaching a stage of their lives when small illnesses are inevitable.
I have to admit that thinking of their future physical condition is mentally stressing for me as we all get old and there is nothing anyone can do to stop that.

Second, I am thankful for the job I am able to keep during this difficult time.
Lots of people, I know some of them personally, experienced serious setbacks in their careers because of the depression the virus is inflicting on the economy.
More importantly, I am able to continue doing what I enjoy doing all the time.

Third, I am grateful for being able to run.
I've got into the habit of running a couple times each week and it always has a refreshing effect on me.
Many times I feel tired in the afternoon after a day's working, but as long as I put on the shoes and run for a while, the energy always comes back to me, which actually makes me feel more refreshed than in the morning.
It's almost the end of the year, and I've gained more than ten pounds of weight.
I believe it would be a bigger number had I not keep running regularly.
Later I learned that it is the hormone called 'dopamine' at work when I feel energetic after running.

I'll surely discover more that's worth thankful for for the rest of the year, and I WILL write more regularly.
