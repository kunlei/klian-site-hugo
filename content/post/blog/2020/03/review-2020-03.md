March turned out to be a tough month for me and the family, and to a larger extend, the whole world that is being scourged by the coronavirus.
It was actually the first time I caught flu, or one that was officially confirmed, and I didn't expect it to be so contagious.
Although we've taken precautions, the flu eventually knocked the whole family down, one by one, first my wife, then my son and my daughter.

And the coronavirus.
When we just saw some good news about China's draconian efforts to contain the virus finally working, the western world suddenly became sick too.
First Italy, then Spain, German and America.
I've been telling my parents that we're relatively safe all this time and urging them to stay home, now it's time for them to worry about our safety.
It's hard not to feel anxious watching the number of confirmed cases and death tolls keeping going up.
The number actually grew so fast in America that it seemed overnight for U.S to become the one with most infected cases.

The word 'unprecedented' has been seen everywhere.
No one probably ever imagined that 2020 could be so devastating.
Normal lives seemed evaporated, and even we keep assuring ourselves that this is just temporary, but no one is absolutely sure that we will be back to those old days.

## Health

I skipped too many exercise sessions in the first half of the month that it seemed the momentum was gone for a while to me to resume working out.
But I managed to have a few exercise sessions in second part the month.
Overall, I ought to ramp up my exercise frequency.

## Skills

Again physical health affects our motivations in many aspects.
I only managed to learn some C++ knowledge regarding smart pointers but haven't got much chance to really use them.
The plan to revisit some linear programming theories was abandoned.

## English

Word list 3 is done. 
It has become a habit to review a few words every day, which is good.

## Reading

I did kept my pace of book reading this month.
Arguably the best book I read this month is *The Great Influenza*, a book that is about the pandemic happened in 1918.
I felt that human is still helpless when nature wants to take back some control.
