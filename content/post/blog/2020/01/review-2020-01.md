It feels like yesterday when I put down the new year resolution, and it's already the end of January, that's one twelfth of 2020 already part of the past!
I'll try to summarize what I have done in this month, which are divided into the following categories.

## Health

I set a goal to have at least two workouts each week and that mediocre target is on track.
I've long accepted the fact that too ambitious a goal often leads to early giving up, and any number above two seems daunting and takes mental tolls.
Instead, twice a week is pretty easy to achieve and anything beyond that feels like a bonus.
My exercise usually consists of two parts, special exercise aimed to build muscles around my waist to help relieve occasional lower back pain and regular exercise on my rowing machine.
I didn't take a note of the number at the beginning of this month, but I believe it's somewhere around 1,700 pulls (the total count now is 6,311, just for the record).

## Skills

I spent a good amount of time refreshing my C++ knowledge, and put the learning into posts really helps solidify the knowledge.
I mainly focused on re-reading the classical book *C++ Primer*, and I can learn something new every single time.
My recent project provides another opportunity to design a large-scale column generation algorithm to solve one of the largest transportation optimization problem.
Put what I've just learned into use proves to be one of the best ways to improve my knowledge on C++

## English

I was diligent on acquiring new words during the first half of the month and I am on target to learn 100 new words this month.
However, I skipped quite some days during the second half of the month, for reasons I don't remember now.
Good thing is that I resume my learning plan recently and try to reserve a small amount of time each day to work on this.

## Reading

I finished a big chunk of the book *Winning the Loser's Game*, which helps me realize the importance of investing and what's the major decision I should focus on in my investing journey.
I am still reading the book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.

## Insomnia

Certain things went on unpleasantly this month, struggling to fall asleep quickly was one of them.
I've gotten used to getting up before 6am for the past few years, which gives me much more productive times to work on important projects in the morning.
For some mysterious reasons I couldn't figure out yet, I suddenly couldn't fall asleep easily as before.
I spent many nights rolling in the bed before finally falling asleep and that usually means I couldn't get up early even if I went to bed early.
I've temporary altered my morning routine in order not to give myself too much pressure to fall asleep, which would only worsen the problem.
I've even completely turned off the alarm and let my mind decide when it wants to rest and shut down.
Good news is that I am starting to get better.

## Coronavirus

Perhaps the saddest thing happened and still happening this month is the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, the city where I spent my memorable seven years, which encompassed both my undergraduate and graduate studies.
Growing up in a very rural area in a neighboring province, wuhan is the first city I've ever lived in, which perhaps shaped what I am right now in many ways that I couldn't imagine.
For example, noodle is a traditional food in my hometown, but I am never fond of it.
However, the wuhan version noodle, which people call it hot dry noodle, is my favorite food, period.
One of motivating factors that got me out of bed when I was studying there was to get the chance to have the hot dry noodle as breakfast.
I don't usually miss thing, but hot dry noodle is definitely an exception.

It's heartbreaking to see the city I lived and loved to suffer this deadly virus.
Every day I monitor the status and sadly see the death toll keeps going up, which is now more than 170 people.
There are also over 8,000 people got infected, according to the official announcement, and I hope they all get well soon.
Wuhan, like most part of the Hubei province, is still in the lock-down mode.
Even in my hometown, people are encouraged to stay at home and villages tried all means to block the road to minimize traffic.
Worst of all, this all happens during the Chinese festival, during which everybody is supposed to reunion with their family after a long year's hard working and just celebrate.
It's with my sincere wishes that China, especially Wuhan, will manage to get over this.
