It's already the third month into working from home, which started from early March, and it's possible that this working mode will continue for another month.
Everything seems to be working, or not working, as usual, with the family staying at home and the coronavirus still ravaging throughout the world.
There's not a single day goes by that there aren't tens of thousands of new confirmed cases; however, people seem to have gotten used to, or tired of, the virus.
Almost all states are in the process of reopening, which seems the only way to go since many people are losing their jobs and many more are going to if lock-down continues.
With the virus still claiming lives, it has largely been upstaged by recent protests over the death of an African American in Minneapolis.
It's like people have gotten so tired of the virus that the tragedy of this man's death ignited people's outrage that's been accumulating for months.

I am reluctant to admit, but I have coping with some mild form of insomnia for the past weeks.
I used to be the one who falls asleep instantly after going to bed, but for some mysterious reasons, falling asleep became hard, starting almost out of thin air.
I would lie in the bed with my eyes closed but my minds totally clear, even I was quite tired before that.
It's hard for me to understand previously why people can't just fall asleep until these days.
The good thing is that I can sleep very well after I fall asleep eventually, without waking up in the middle of the night.
Perhaps this is the new norm for me, and like the virus, I'll get over it sometime soon.

On the work side, I'd spent most of my time working on the same project and I've got more and deeper understanding of the problem over the time.
It's my first time working on an optimization project at this scale, and I'm still excited to be able to use column generation to solve it.
It's a reciprocal process in which better understanding of the algorithm leads to better solution approach specifically developed for this problem, and researching into the problem itself leads to deepened comprehension of the strengths and weakness of the algorithm.

At home, I took a few tours to HomeDepot to buy lots more stuff, like lawn seed, fertilizer and all kinds of tools.
Our lawn has been a bit patchy as some spots have dead grass, which makes it look ugly.
I've tried to reseed the lawn and hope the grass will grow back.
Our garden in the backyard is thriving after we applied the insect killer and gardening fertilizer.
It's the place I like to visit every day to see positive changes.
