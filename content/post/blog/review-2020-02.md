February is coming to an end today and it's time to review what I've done in the past four weeks.

## Health

I was mostly on target this month, with at least two exercises each week.
Workout on the rolling machine could be a bit boring, and usually 200 pulls are the maximum I can endure.
However, I found a way to extend this, by coupling the exercise with another hobby of watching video clips.
Although I never played video games on a regular basis, I did enjoy watching recaps performed by professional players.
It's like basketball or football games so many other people revel in, watching video games could be a bit of relaxation.
I picked up the hobby recently inadvertently and I found that doing it together with exercise could benefit both my body and mind.
The book I read about habits suggests coupling routines could help cultivate beneficial habits.

## Skills

I spent quite a bit time on reviewing linear programming basics, mainly for reviewing some techniques needed for improving the performance of column generation that is being used in the project I am working on.
It's clear that knowledge not actively used tends to fade into the memory, like the basics of simplex algorithm and duality theory.
I've multiple attempts to refresh the memory about them but time again they are hard to retrieve when needed, which may suggest that I never successfully solidify the knowledge into my mental representation of the optimization subject.
Still a better way could be writing it down on my blog as a way of internalizing the knowledge, which is what I've been trying to do recently.

C++ is another area that I am trying to work on.
The book *C++ Primer* has been a good read and I've picked up lots of useful knowledge from it.
This month is mainly about the memory control model in C++.

## English

I am 100 percent on target in acquiring new english words this month, with another 100 words memorized and reviewed multiple times.
It has become a daily routine to spend about ten minutes on learning or reviewing english words, and it's a good way to energize my morning productivity.

## Reading

I read a couple of books this month, including *Your money or your life* and *Better than before*.
In fact, I find that I tend to indulge myself into spending too much time reading every day, and a reading time cap might be needed for the coming month.
