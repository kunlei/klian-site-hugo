I've failed many times in countless occasions throughout my life, and failures themselves rarely set me back.
I'm mostly proud of what I've accomplished at this moment and the direction my life is moving towards, given the humble background I grew up from.
It's until I read this book named *Black Box Thinking* that I glimpse the key factors that propels me out of less-advantaged or even adverse situations.

Back in high school when everybody was preparing for the college entrance exam, I did well in most exams and eventually scored high enough to get myself into a top university in China.
It seemed puzzling to me that many of my hard-working peers couldn't improve their scores, regardless how many hours they put into learning and study.
I consider myself no whiz student and mediocre in properly all fields, but my scores at that time seemed to be able to gradually improve.
I was seemly studying, failing and learning from my failures, and trying not to make the same mistake again.
It turns out that recognizing the failures and seizing them as opportunities to improve indicate a good path to learn and make progress.

The author uses the aviation industry as an exemplar of embracing failures to increase airline safety.
Putting tons of metal in the air and making it fly with hundreds of people always seem daunting.
Every flight accident attracts extensive attentions from media and the general public, while driving accidents, albeit causing way more death tolls, blend into our daily lives and barely receives any attention at all.
Contrary to this impression, flying turns out to be one of the safest way to travel.
Why so?
While not many drivers reflect on their near-misses or minor accidents, which prods them to make the same mistakes again and again, the aviation industry sees every failure as an opportunity to learn in order not to make the same mistake again.

The health care industry represents an adverse example in which lots of medical practitioners routinely shy away from their mistakes, even when the lives of patients are at stake.
It's somewhat understandable that one won't want to admit his/her incompetency after years of medical training, but it's still sad to learn the denying acts of people who have direct impacts on people's lives and well-beings.
