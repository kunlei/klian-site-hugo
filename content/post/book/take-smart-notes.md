**Take Smart Notes** is probably the best book I'll read this year, although it's just half way into it.
I used to be, and to some extent still am, the type of student who learn by reading and re-reading, and seldom take notes.
As I reflect on this, part of the reason might be that books used to be precious resources for me when I was young.
My books, textbooks for the most part, are always clean and void of any notes because I didn't have the luxury to buy as many book as I wanted and I didn't like to see books getting dirty by writing notes in them.
Perhaps this scarcity has done more bad than good in my learning journal, although it's supposed to be a tool to help me learn.

So what should we do while reading? take notes.
It happens often that the books didn't register with me the moment I finish it and I can hardly recall anything from them.
The reading process turns out to be a mere one-way understanding journal and no elaboration is involved.
The author promotes a better way of reading - with a pen and paper on hand, and write down your interpretation whenever something resonates with you.
More importantly, one is advised to put the notes into a so-called *slip-box* that serves as the central place for saving and connecting notes.
By connecting notes, interesting topics will cluster and emerge over time, which serves as natural candidate to write something about, either as an article or a book.

Note taking makes particular sense for learning something new.
When we approach a new subject for the first time, we typically find a book to read and sometimes mere reading could give us a false impression that we've understood the subject.
Unfortunately, when we try to use the knowledge in a new context, we can't recall it as as thought we would.
In these cases, it's better to write notes during the process of learning.
The notes could take the form of explaining the things we just learned in layman's term.
Only if we can elaborate a point can we safely say that we've grasped a concept.
Note taking is as simple as is, and is no way a revolutionary idea, many people are probably always use it.
Let's start taking notes.
