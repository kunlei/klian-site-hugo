1. Explain in general terms (1 paragraph) why the specific Staff Data Scientist position offered to you is essential to Wal-Martâ€™s business activities (i.e., more details about the Staff Data Scientist position and the tasks you perform in this position).

As the industry-leading retailer that operates over 11,000 stores worldwide, Walmart serves millions of customers to fulfill their daily needs. Vital to Walmart's survival and growth in today's increasingly competitive retailing market is its capability to make items available at competitive prices, which requires a strong supply chain to move millions of items efficiently from thousands of suppliers to stores. In unprecedented events like the coronavirus pandemic, supply chain efficiency matters more as it affects whether millions of households can have the essentials when needed. On the other hand, reducing costs in various components of the supply chain decides whether Walmart can maintain a lucrative business and thrive in its competition with major rivals like Amazon and Target. The Staff Data Scientist is a unique position within Walmart's supply chain technology department that aims to employ operations research theories and techniques to optimize some key processes in the supply chain. This is a challenging task considering Walmart business scale, but it also represents numerous opportunities to achieve tremendous cost savings. The job performed at this position includes optimization over replenishment, transportation and fulfillment in supply chain. Replenishment involves determining the best time and quantity to order items from suppliers with the objective of minimizing item out-of-stock and thus increasing item availability. The inventory optimization project I participated and the associated patent falls in the replenishment category. We proposed an advanced inventory optimization algorithm utilizing simulation and GPU computing to decide the optimal inventory level and order quantities for Walmart stores, which has the potential to save Walmart millions of dollars annually. Transportation refers to the process of moving produced items from suppliers to Walmart distribution centers or stores using Walmart's private fleet. The load builder optimization project I am working on now aims to decide the best way to bundle items together so that the minimal number of trucks are needed to conduct the shipment. The potential annual cost saving resulting from the project could be millions of dollars too. The fulfillment operation is mainly concerned with distribution center operations, and the grocery profiling optimization project I worked on tries to determine the best slot location for every item in the center so that the order fulfillment process could be conducted most efficiently. All the projects requires designing and implementing advanced optimization algorithms based on solid mathematical and theoretical background in operations research.

Data is the foundation of any optimization project and getting the right and complete data set is the first step in building an optimization algorithm. Walmart produces huge amount of data on a daily basis, and gathering all the required data in a correct and timely manner is the key to delivering a successful product. There are some main activities in the data gathering process:

1) data source identification: Walmart employs various data platforms to host its historical as well as forecasting data that are valuable to its business operation. Data gathering always starts with identifying the correct data platform, which requires exploring available databases to see whether the needed data are available. Often there exist many data tables within a database and the required information resides in multiple database; sometimes, information across different data platforms must be connected together to get the complete data set. The exploration and connection process requires deep understanding of the characteristics of various data platforms and the relationship between different data tables. Significant amount of research and reasoning is often desired to reach the final stage.
2) data retrieval: after all the data sources are identified and their mutual relationships are figured out, the next step is to actually retrieve the data from these difference data platforms into a single place. This step is called referred to as data pipeline building. It is common to utilize different techniques that correspond to the target data platforms in order to get the data correctly. In addition, enough attention needs to be paid to the stability of the data retrieval process and backup plan needs to be devised to take care of worst scenarios. This process requires proficient programming skills and research capability to come up with the desired data pipeline.
3) data cleaning: the data retrieved often contains raw data or erroneous information that needs to be pinpointed and filtered out. This is an essential step as wrong data leads to wrong optimization results. In this step, scientific methods must be utilized to avoid removing correct data and to make sure wrong data is removed totally. This is often a iterative process that involves rigorous testing and improvement.
4) data transformation: the data obtained from the previous steps might not be in the expected formats required by the optimization algorithm and it's therefore necessary to conduct data transformation to shape the data into the ultimate optimal optimization input. For example, an item's information may be stored in multiple data tables which need to be joined to get the full item profile.

+	Research new trends and best practices in the industry and utilize up-to-date technologies to support assigned projects.
