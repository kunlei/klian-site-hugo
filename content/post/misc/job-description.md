1. Explain in general terms (1 paragraph) why the specific Staff Data Scientist position offered to you is essential to Wal-Martâ€™s business activities (i.e., more details about the Staff Data Scientist position and the tasks you perform in this position).

As the industry-leading brick and mortar retailer operating over 11,000 stores worldwide, Walmart serves millions of customers, both in store and online website, every day. Item availability and cost competitiveness are the two key functions that Walmart has to perform extremely well in order to survive the increasingly competitive retailing market. It is essential to make items available whenever customers enter a store or click online to make purchases, and improving item availability is the core business activity Walmart performs constantly. Making items available to customers requires moving them from tens of thousands of suppliers to stores in a timely manner, which necessitates an optimized supply chain in terms of efficiency throughout the whole network.  In addition, Walmart strives for every day low prices for customers to retain competitive advantages over competitors like Amazon and Target, and therefore cost-saving is the only way to make its business lucrative. However, the item supply chain is very complex given Walmart's business scale and numerous opportunities exist to reduce overall costs.

The Staff Data Scientist position is responsible for employing operations research expertise to optimize some of the key processes within the supply chain, including replenishment, transportation and fulfillment. Replenishment involves determining the best time and quantity to order items from suppliers with the objective of minimizing item out-of-stock and thus increasing item availability. The inventory optimization project I participated and the associated patent falls in the replenishment category. We proposed an advanced inventory optimization algorithm utilizing simulation and GPU computing to decide the optimal inventory level and order quantities for Walmart stores, which has the potential to save Walmart millions of dollars annually. Transportation refers to the process of moving produced items from suppliers to Walmart distribution centers or stores using Walmart's private fleet. The load builder optimization project I am working on now aims to decide the best way to bundle items together so that the minimal number of trucks are needed to conduct the shipment. The potential annual cost saving resulting from the project could be millions of dollars too. The fulfillment operation is mainly concerned with distribution center operations, and the grocery profiling optimization project I worked on tries to determine the best slot location for every item in the center so that the order fulfillment process could be conducted most efficiently.
All the projects requires designing and implementing advanced optimization algorithms based on solid mathematical and theoretical background in operations research.

Data is the foundation of any optimization project and getting the right and complete data set is the first step in building an optimization algorithm. Walmart produces huge amount of data on a daily basis, and gathering all the required data in a correct and timely manner is the key to delivering a successful product. There are some main activities in the data gathering process:

1) data source identification: Walmart employs various data platforms to host its historical as well as forecasting data that are valuable to its business operation. Data gathering always starts with identifying the correct data platform, which requires exploring available databases to see whether the needed data are available. Often there exist many data tables within a database and the required information resides in multiple database; sometimes, information across different data platforms must be connected together to get the complete data set. The exploration and connection process requires deep understanding of the characteristics of various data platforms and the relationship between different data tables. Significant amount of research and reasoning is often desired to reach the final stage.
2) data retrieval: after all the data sources are identified and their mutual relationships are figured out, the next step is to actually retrieve the data from these difference data platforms into a single place. This step is called referred to as data pipeline building. It is common to utilize different techniques that correspond to the target data platforms in order to get the data correctly. In addition, enough attention needs to be paid to the stability of the data retrieval process and backup plan needs to be devised to take care of worst scenarios. This process requires proficient programming skills and research capability to come up with the desired data pipeline.
3) data cleaning: the data retrieved often contains raw data or erroneous information that needs to be pinpointed and filtered out. This is an essential step as wrong data leads to wrong optimization results. In this step, scientific methods must be utilized to avoid removing correct data and to make sure wrong data is removed totally. This is often a iterative process that involves rigorous testing and improvement.
4) data transformation: the data obtained from the previous steps might not be in the expected formats required by the optimization algorithm and it's therefore necessary to conduct data transformation to shape the data into the ultimate optimal optimization input. For example, an item's information may be stored in multiple data tables which need to be joined to get the full item profile.

+	Research new trends and best practices in the industry and utilize up-to-date technologies to support assigned projects.

Walmart business is thriving all the years and the scale of the optimization problems is continuously increasing. It's vital to keep track of the recent advances in the industry and aptly adopt new and best practices to make the final optimization products better. Below are a few examples:

1) processing a huge amount of data in a timely manner is the key to the success of an optimization product, and the industry is constantly evolving to come up with better techniques to address this. A new programming language may emerge that possesses superior parallel processing capability and applying it in the optimization life cycle may significantly improve the performance of the optimization product.
2) real-world optimization problems are usually characterized by large scale and typically take long computational times. More effective and efficient algorithms emerge from time to time that bring huge computational time savings for solving problems of the same time. It's therefore beneficial to adopt the new advance into daily product development to improve product performance.
3) industry best practice is time tested and user validated, and can bring tremendous performance improvement regarding product stability and maintenance ease.
