When I worked on an optimization project a few weeks back, the phrase 'whack-a-mole' was used often to describe the behavior of the optimizer.
The decision variables themselves were straightforward, most of them were binary variables and the problem took minimal times to solve.
The difficulty came with the numerous constrains brought up by the business partners.
Although the constraints all make sense from the operation perspective, including them into the model makes it infeasible most of the time.
So with the desire to have a feasible solution, penalty terms are associated with constraint violations so that the model would violate some of the constraints in order to produce a feasible solution.
Convenient as it sounds, solution vagaries emerge as the model has all the freedom to relax any constraint.
To address abnormal optimization results, some additional hard constraints were added to enforce certain requirements, attempting to shape the optimizer behavior towards what's expected and explicable.
However, what's often seen was that the model would seek other opportunity to relax other constraints that were not desired either.
The process was like whacking the moles that could pop up anywhere.

This post is actually not intended to discuss how optimization should be done, rather I am trying to help myself internalize the word 'whack' and its usage.
I've been trying to build up my vocabulary and 'whack' came about again today that I decided to look it up:

> whack: to hit sb/sth hard

I'll probably never forget the word after I relate it to the story above.
Interestingly, I read another article today that explains how the stock market has got *out of whack* with the real economy.
I personally believe idiom is one of the most challenging steps in learning a new language.
Just like Chinese has tons of idioms that we accumulate through years of learning, the numerous English idioms are pretty much new to me.
The *out of whack* basically means:

> out of order; not working

Some example include:

> Out budget is out of whack.
> The supply chain is out of whack.
