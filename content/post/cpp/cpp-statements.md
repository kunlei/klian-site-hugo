Statements end with a semicolon and cause expressions to be evaluated.

There are various types of statements:

- Expression statement: an expression followed by a semicolon becomes an expression statement.
- Null statement: an empty expression with a semicolon forms a null statement.
- Compound statement: multiple statements create a compound statement using a pair of curly braces, also called a block.
- Conditional statement: both the `if` statement and `switch` statement are conditional statements.
- Iterative statement: the `for`, `while` and `do while` are all iterative statements.
