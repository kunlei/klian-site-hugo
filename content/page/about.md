Hello! My name is Kunlei Lian, and I work as a Staff Data Scientist at [Walmart Labs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/).

## Wait, Data Scientist?

Yeah, I know. You probably couldn't get any flavor of data science in my posts here, BECAUSE I AM NOT DOING ANY DATA SCIENCE WORK.
Data scientist is a big umbrella in Walmart and I am actually an undercover Operations Research Scientist (don't ask where I work:-)\).
I do all kinds of optimization works in supply chain area, routing is my favorite.

## What's This Site For

I tend to forget things if I don't jot them down at the moment of learning or active using.
I am also a firm believer of output-driven learning strategy, which promotes facilitating, enhancing and internalizing the learning through consciously writing it down and publishing it.
After all, one has to understand a subject good enough in order to share it, and the process of writing is a very good way of digesting new knowledge.
Therefore, this site will contain lots of learning notes, many of which will be preliminary, but I hope I will be able to contribute more advanced contents in the future with the help of this deliberate practice.

## Educational Background

Prior to working for Walmart Labs, I spent four years studying Industrial Engineering at [University of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu) and got my Ph.D. in 2017.
My dissertation, titled in Service Consistency in Vehicle Routing, centers on *studying service consistency in vehicle routing problems* spanning over multiple days. Previously, I got my Masters and Bachelors, both in industrial engineering, from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn) in 2012 and 2009, respectively.

## Irrelevant

I originally put the below formulation here for testing the LaTex rendering, and somehow found it beautiful and silly (as the optimal solution is obviously 0 for all $x_i$), so I decided to keep it here.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{min.} \quad & \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}}x_i \newline
\text{s.t.} \quad & x_i \in \{0, 1\}, \ \forall i \in \mathcal{I}
\end{align}
$$
