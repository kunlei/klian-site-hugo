Hello! My name is Kunlei Lian, and I'm a Sr. Data Scientist working at [Walmart Labs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/).

## What's This Site For

I tend to forget things if I don't jot them down at the moment of learning or active using.
I am also a firm believer of output-driven learning strategy, which promotes facilitating, enhancing and internalizing the learning through consciously writing it down and publishing it.
After all, one has to understand a subject good enough in order to share it, and the process of writing is a very good way of digesting new knowledge.
Therefore, this site will contain lots of learning notes, many of which will be preliminary, but I hope I will be able to contribute more advanced contents in the future with the help of this deliberate practice.

## Educational Background

Prior to working for Walmart Labs, I spent four years studying Industrial Engineering at [University of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu) and got my Ph.D. in 2017.
My dissertation, titled in Service Consistency in Vehicle Routing, centers on *studying service consistency in vehicle routing problems* spanning over multiple days. Previously, I got my Masters and Bachelors, both in industrial engineering, from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn) in 2012 and 2009, respectively.
